# facial-expression-classification
**Udacity AWS Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree**

This project focuses on classifying human facial emotions using a fine-tuned ResNet50 convolutional neural network. The goal is to achieve robust emotion recognition by experimenting with various hyperparameter ranges and leveraging AWS infrastructure for training, deployment, and inference.

The model was trained on the FER-2013 dataset, a widely-used benchmark dataset for facial emotion recognition. All code, training jobs, and model deployments are done on AWS SageMaker, making the project scalable, reproducible, and production-ready.
